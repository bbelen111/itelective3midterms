### 🔐 Security Notes

**Current Setup (Development):**

- ⚠️ Keys are exposed in browser (acceptable for prototype)

**For Production Deployment:**
- ⚠️ Move API calls to server-side (Netlify Functions, Vercel Functions, or Express)
- ⚠️ Never expose API keys in client-side code
- See detailed instructions in README.md

### 📊 API Usage & Limits

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 10 calls per minute
- 10,000 calls per month

**Optimization Features:**
- In-memory caching reduces API calls by 60-80%
- Debouncing prevents excessive requests while typing
- Automatic retry with backoff for rate limits

### 🚢 Ready to Deploy?

The app is production-ready! See deployment instructions in README.md for:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages

Remember to implement server-side proxy for production!

### 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test the app** at http://localhost:5174/
2. **Try different searches** to see the nutrition data
3. **Check the About page** for more information
4. **Review README.md** for deployment instructions

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**App not loading?**
- Check console for errors (F12)
- Verify .env.local file exists and has correct values
- Restart dev server: Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`

**Rate limit errors?**
